## Getting started

First you will need to install purescript and pulp if you haven't already.
Then run the following commands to install OutWatch.

    $ bower install purescript-outwatch
    $ npm install rxjs snabbdom

And you're done, you can now start building your own OutWatch app!
Please check out the [documentation](https://outwatch.github.io/) on how to proceed.


## Three main goals of OutWatch

1. Updating DOM efficiently without sacrificing abstraction => Virtual DOM
2. Handling subscriptions automatically
3. Removing or restricting the need for Higher Order Observables
